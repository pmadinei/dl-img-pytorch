# Introduction
During this project a deep neural network has been designed and implemented for products' images classification by utilizing PyTorch built-in functions. Additionally, all the hyperparameters in a neural network, including learning rate, L2 regularization method, activation function, normalizing data, weight initialization, batch size, epoch size, and momentum have been tuned for better results.
